# Commons Lang

Commons Lang provides a host of helper utilities for Dart / Flutter applications, most notably String manipulation methods and basic numerical methods.

Note that this project is still in its early stages and so may not yet provide complete/full functionality. We will be building up functionality over the next few months through numerous small iterative releases.
